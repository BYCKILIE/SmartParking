Experience seamless parking management with our Smart Parking System, offering users the convenience of reserving parking slots for specific dates and times.

Key Features:

Frontend + Backend Applications: Our system comprises both frontend and backend applications, seamlessly integrated to provide a user-friendly experience. The frontend, built using Vite and React, offers intuitive interfaces for users to browse available parking slots, make reservations, and manage their bookings. On the backend, we leverage the robust Django framework to power our API, facilitating communication between the frontend, backend, and hardware components.

Hardware Support: In addition to the digital interface, our Smart Parking System includes hardware support for real-world implementation. Demonstrated using Raspberry Pi, our hardware components showcase how the system interacts with physical infrastructure, such as sensors and indicators, to monitor parking availability and update reservation statuses in real-time.
